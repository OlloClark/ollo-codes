          Hi! I'm Ollo Clark, a software engineer with a background in theater, education, 
          and management consultancy. A fascination with language, logic, 
          and puzzles allows me to tackle difficult or opaque problems with curiosity, 
          energy and humor. Six years of stage work taught me real teamwork, while eight years of teaching 
          taught me communication, connection, and patience.
          <br><br>
          I recently graduate from General Assembly's Software Engineering Intensive.
          Below, you can find several projects, each built in no more than five days.
          Enjoy!

          Something is asking for your help...or is it a demand? 
          Assist as you will, but all might not be as it seems...

          CATCH THEM is the result of going from never having written a line of code to having coded for three
          weeks. I'm also confident it's the only
          wordsearch in the world with a secret alternative ending.
          <br><br>
          I'm a big thriller/horror fan, and I like putting
          new twists on old classics. Help catch them, if you dare.

          Streets don't need furniture. People do.

          We were asked to build a CRUD-fulfilling database as a project, and I didn't want to just submit
          something for the sake of it; I wanted to build something useful. I aim to make Furnish LA fully mobile,
          and my intention is to add geocentric photo functionality.
